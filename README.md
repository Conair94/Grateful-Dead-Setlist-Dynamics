# Ideas and things to study
1. Node classification problems
2. Set List "exceptionality" score via anomaly detection
3. Time Series evolution of set list Markov chain over time, discretely by decade and then also simple moving average
4. Mood signal Analysis looking at types of songs played in a set in sequence (rocker>jam>ballad>high-energy-jam>drums/experimental>ballad>etc)
5. Shannon-style information entropy analysis.
6. A nice UI and website to create and interact with diagrams
